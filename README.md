# Nodejs and Express 



nodejs works on a single thread, non blocking I/O and it handles it in a loop



## Nodejs is best to use:

- Rest API

- Microservices

- Realtime applications

- CRUD applications (blog/shopping cart)

- Tools and Utilities (command line tools as an example)



there are core module like:

- path

- filesystem (fs)

- http



to use them, you will call them in a variable (mostly they will be constants)
